## Choosing a text editor

- allows you to write and manage text that is typed on websites
- most important features are:

1. code completion

- you start typing and whatever you type has a suggestion whihc allows you to save time

2. syntax highlighting

- takes the text you type and makes it a diff color

3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)

- allow you to change the color of the background of your text editor, the series of colors in your text, and sometimes themes will affect other aspects of your text editing software as well

4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them

- adds functionality on the go
- Based on the Text editor you choose, the better the functionaly and features the less mistakes and time you will make.

### Intro to Using a Terminal

- A termina line is a text based interface to the system.
- Typically presents you with a prompt

**Relative path**
-A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.

**Absolute path**
-A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.

**File**
-obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.

**ls -a**
-List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
-Everything is a file under Linux // Even directories.
-Linux is an extensionless system // Files can have any extension they like or none at all.
-Linux is case sensitive // Beware of silly typos.

- **Basic Commands**
- PWD: where am I
  - print working directory
- LS: list all current contents
  - see where everything is
- CD: change directory
  - move into new folder
  - project - courses - directories
    - for each class
- MKDIR: make directory/new folder
  - mkdir class102
- CLEAR: cleans up the terminal
- Touch (add space) (file name): adds a new file
  - ex: touch demo.md
- cd .. goes back one directory
  - each . goes back a folder
  - .. is one ... is two ... is three etc.
- Tree: visual rep of where we started to where we're at
- ~ (tilde) - This is a shortcut for your home directory.
  - ex: if your home directory is /home/ryan then you could refer to the directory  
    - path /home/ryan/Documents or ~/Documents
- . (dot) - This is a reference to your current directory.
- .. (dotdot)- This is a reference to the parent directory. You can use this several times in a path to keep going up the hierarchy.
  - ex: if you were in the path /home/ryan you could run the command ls ../../ and this would do a listing of the root directory.
